What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git starts tracking my files in the directory. I want Git to track my files so that I can have different versions and be able to revert back if bugs happened in later versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the media stage that files will be added and pushed to the repository for record. The working directory is the place where I work on my files.

change?
